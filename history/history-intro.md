> You know, I didn't want to live. At that moment, it seemed that this no longer makes sense. My son is dead. He died in my arms. I can still see his face distorted with anguish. We fought, tried to stop this nightmare, but could not, did not have time. He relapsed over and over again. The last dose of drugs and alcohol was fatal for him. My boy was only 19 years oldÂ».

Says **Anastasia Semenova**, founder of the "Line of color" charitable foundation. The history of our organization began with this tragedy.
