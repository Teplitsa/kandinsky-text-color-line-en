<h3 style="text-align:center;">What we do</h3>

We work hard with everyone who turned to us for help, with their families, friends and those who are ready to support a person on the way to a sober lifestyle.

We act **in three directions.**

- Information and educational activities about the dangers and harmfulness of alcohol. We conduct seminars for those who are ready to support a person in his recovery. We organize closed anonymous communication groups where everyone can find support, speak and tell their story of recovery and return to life.
- We provide support in overcoming alcohol addiction during short-term and long-term recovery processes. We organize communication and rehabilitation groups, individual consultations, examinations with doctors, prepare recommendations and a personal recovery plan.
- We provide long-term post-recovery support. We help to find a job, restore documents, establish relationships with family and friends, and get additional education. Make plans and dreams come true.

//Now it's time to clearly and clearly tell what you are doing. Divide the activities into sections, so it will be easier for the user to understand your activity and relate to their specific case. In this form, it will be much easier for them to perceive all the information visually. The user will "jump" from section to section.
