> "Take off the top and I'll buy it‚Äù he said with an oily, lustful smile and handed me a note. And I took off and sold my shirt to buy some booze. It was nine o'clock in the morning. Probably, at that very moment, when I was walking half-naked down the street with a can of beer in my hand, I realized that my life was drowned in this muddy slurry. And I also burst into tears from the understanding that I would give more in exchange for a bottle. I reached the bottom, and it seemed that there was no way out, I am a goner and everything that I dreamed of, all the plans that I made for life, I ruined through drinking. 
This letter was written by <strong>Nastya T</strong>., she was the first to come to our charitable organization "Line of Color" two days after we opened the doors of our small office. Since then we have been helping everyone who is ready to give up alcohol addiction and want to return color to their lives. Instead of the black pain of loss, fear, and disappointment, we give stable support and help in overcoming the addiction.

[knd_key_phrase subtitle="Our mission"]To inspire, help and support people in their fight against alcohol addiction.[/knd_key_phrase]
