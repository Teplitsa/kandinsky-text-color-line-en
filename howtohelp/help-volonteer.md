<h3 style="text-align:center;">Become a volunteer</h3>

**112 volunteers** are helping Line of Color at the moment.

Join our team and become a volunteer or consultant in our projects. Our volunteer program is divided into two parts. The first is the curators of support groups, event organizers, interns in the organization's office, programmers and journalists. The second is professional volunteers, lawyers, doctors, psychologists, financial consultants.

Our coordinators of the volunteer movement make **weekly work plans for all participants**, work schedules, making a newsletter to keep everyone informed.

It doesn't matter how much time you have. We look forward to any participation. And we will individually discuss with you your schedule and projects in which you can participate.

**Fill out the volunteer form. We will contact you immediately.**
