The non-profit organization "Line of Color" has created and is running a curriculum on the dangers of alcohol for high school students. The program was created jointly with the Novosibirsk Institute of Pharmacology and Healthcare of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The program is included in the curriculum in 100 schools across the country.

Over the two years of operation, the program has shown encouraging results. According to a survey by the Anisimov & Partners sociological center, 95 percent of the students who took part in the program indicated that they understand much better what harm alcohol can cause to their health. 79 percent of the participants said they were willing to significantly reduce their drinking. 83 percent - that they will seek help if alcohol leads them to addiction.

> In the private part of the study, students indicated that after completing the program, they reduced their alcohol consumption by an average of 20 percent.

Based on the results of the curriculum, we came up with an initiative to introduce this curriculum to educational institutions throughout the country. At the moment, the project is being discussed at the government level and the program is being improved. We are working on adapting learning content for students of different ages.

A separate part of the program is aimed at educating teachers and parents. A special course has been created for them within the framework of the curriculum.

### The program includes six stages:

* Meetings of parents. Discussion of medical aspects and informing them about the harmful effects of alcohol on the body of adolescents.
* Discussion of methods of persuading and motivating adolescents not to abuse alcohol.
* Classrooms with a general education program on the dangers of alcohol.
* Joint meetings of parents and teenagers with performances by invited guests and stories of those who have overcome alcohol addiction.
* Anonymous counseling for schoolchildren who are ready to give up alcohol.
* Special programs about foods and drinks that can replace alcohol.
