This rehabilitation program is designed for those who have received treatment and are ready to move on. We offer them various educational programs to restore professional skills or acquire a new profession. As part of this program, we also provide assistance in the restoration of documents, job search, and give advice on financial discipline.

### The program has three areas:

* "Creation". A series of master classes for those who would like to unleash their creative potential. Lessons in photography, drawing, gardening.
* "Professional". School of Programming and Web Design. Three-month full-time courses on teaching different programming languages. After finishing school we help with employment.
* "New life". Life skills seminar series. During 12 lessons, the participants will learn the features of financial literacy for a stable life, learn how to rationally use the opportunities that have opened up, learn the psychological skills of permanent refusal from alcohol, explore various creative possibilities that a sober lifestyle opens up for them.

Enrollment in educational programs is carried out at the request of the participants based on the results of the program of cessation of alcohol dependence.
