The program was developed jointly with the Moscow city government. It aims to provide social and rehabilitative protection for women with alcohol dependence who have suffered from violence. As part of this project, we provide temporary housing, doctors and psychologists to women survivors of violence. Women who come to us can undergo a program of rehabilitation and treatment for alcoholism.

The Moscow government has provided a block in a secluded sanatorium outside the city for the program. Here, in a safe haven, women can recover from their injuries, receive treatment, and communicate with anonymous support groups.

 # The program consists of four stages: #

* Rehabilitation. Help of doctors, psychologists, lawyers.
* Treatment. A two-month program to help you quit alcohol.
* Adaptation. Psychological assistance courses.
* New let. A series of individual consultations with specialists in building a new life.

Upon completion of this program, those who wish can join other programs of our center.
