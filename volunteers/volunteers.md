<h3 style="text-align:center;">The volunteer program is divided into two parts</h3>

**First** are support group coordinators, event organizers, interns in the organization's office, programmers and journalists.

**Second** are professional volunteers, lawyers, doctors, psychologists, financial consultants.

Our volunteer movement coordinators draw up weekly work plans for all participants, work schedules, and send you a newsletter to keep you updated.

It doesn't matter how much time you have. We look forward to any participation. And we will individually discuss with you your schedule and projects in which you can participate.

Join our team and become a volunteer or consultant in our projects.

**Fill out the volunteer form. We will contact you immediately.** (Form)Â
